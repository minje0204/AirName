It became rare by the end of the Middle Ages, but was revived in the 18th century.Famous bearers include the British poet Alfred Tennyson (1809-1892), the Swedish inventor and Nobel Prize founder Alfred Nobel (1833-1896), and the British-American film director Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980).", "attribute": {"A Good Name": 191, "A Bad Name": 64, "Masculine": 242, "Feminine": 13, "Classic": 224, "Modern": 31, "Mature": 199, "Youthful": 56, "Formal": 214, "Informal": 41, "Upper Class": 166, "Common": 89, "Urban": 99, "Natural": 156, "Wholesome": 201, "Devious": 54, "Strong": 207, "Delicate": 48, "Refined": 189, "Rough": 66, "Strange": 148, "Boring": 107, "Simple": 161, "Complex": 94, "Serious": 184, "Comedic": 71, "Nerdy": 191, "Unintellectual": 64}}, {"name": "Alfreda", "gender": "F", "usage": ["English", "Italian", "Polish (Rare)", "German (Rare)"], "meaning": "\nFeminine form of Alfred.\n", "attribute": {"A Good Name": 31, "A Bad Name": 21, "Masculine": 5, "Feminine": 47, "Classic": 40, "Modern": 12, "Mature": 43, "Youthful": 9, "Formal": 35, "Informal": 17, "Upper Class": 33, "Common": 20, "Urban": 29, "Natural": 23, "Wholesome": 35, "Devious": 17, "Strong": 38, "Delicate": 14, "Refined": 29, "Rough": 23, "Strange": 37, "Boring": 15, "Simple": 25, "Complex": 27, "Serious": 32, "Comedic": 20, "Nerdy": 33, "Unintellectual": 19}}, {"name": "Algar", "gender": "M", "usage": ["English (Rare)"], "meaning": "\nMeans \"elf spear\" from Old English \u00e6lf \"elf\" and gar \"spear\".

He may or may not have been based on a real person. He first appears in Welsh poems and chronicles (perhaps briefly in the 7th-century poem Y Gododdin and more definitively and extensively in the 9th-century History of the Britons [1]). However, his character was not developed until the chronicles of the 12th-century Geoffrey of Monmouth [2]. His tales were later taken up and expanded by French and English writers.The name came into general use in England in the Middle Ages due to the prevalence of Arthurian romances, and it enjoyed a surge of popularity in the 19th century.

Elijah confronted the king and queen over their idolatry of the Canaanite god Ba'al and other wicked deeds. At the end of his life he was carried to heaven in a chariot of fire, and was succeeded by Elisha. In the New Testament, Elijah and Moses appear next to Jesus when he is transfigured.Because Elijah was a popular figure in medieval tales, and because his name was borne by a few early saints (who are usually known by the Latin form Elias), the name came into general use during the Middle Ages.

It was also borne by an 11th-century Austrian saint, who is sometimes called Hemma.After the Norman Conquest this name became common in England. It was revived in the 18th century, perhaps in part due to Matthew Prior's 1709 poem Henry and Emma [2]. It was also used by Jane Austen for the central character, the matchmaker Emma Woodhouse, in her novel Emma (1816).In the United States, it was third in rank in 1880 (behind only the ubiquitous Mary and Anna). It declined steadily over the next century, beginning another rise in the 1980s and eventually becoming the most popular name for girls in 2008. At this time it also experienced similar levels of popularity elsewhere, including the United Kingdom (where it began rising a decade earlier), Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Scandinavia and the Netherlands.

The Hebrew form occurs in the Old Testament (spelled Johanan or Jehohanan in the English version), but this name owes its popularity to two New Testament characters, both highly revered saints. The first is John the Baptist, a Jewish ascetic who is considered the forerunner of Jesus. He baptized Jesus and was later executed by Herod Antipas. The second is the apostle John, who is traditionally regarded as the author of the fourth gospel and Revelation. With the apostles Peter and James (his brother), he was part of the inner circle of Jesus.This name was initially more common among Eastern Christians in the Byzantine Empire, but it flourished in Western Europe after the First Crusade. In England it became extremely popular, typically being the most common male name from the 13th to the 20th century (but sometimes outpaced by William). During the later Middle Ages it was given to approximately a fifth of all English boys. In the United States it was the most common name for boys until 1923.The name (in various spellings) has been borne by 21 popes and eight Byzantine emperors, as well as rulers of England, France, Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Portugal, Bulgaria, Russia and Hungary. It was also borne by the poet John Milton (1608-1674), philosopher John Locke (1632-1704), American founding father and president John Adams (1735-1826), and poet John Keats (1795-1821).

In the New Testament John the Baptist baptizes Jesus Christ in its waters, and it was adopted as a personal name in Europe after crusaders brought water back from the river to baptize their children. There may have been some influence from the Germanic name Jordanes, notably borne by a 6th-century Gothic historian.This name died out after the Middle Ages, but was revived in the 19th century. In America and other countries it became fairly popular in the second half of the 20th century. A famous bearer of the surname is former basketball star Michael Jordan (1963-).\n", "attribute": {"A Good Name": 670, "A Bad Name": 200, "Masculine": 566, "Feminine": 304, "Classic": 304, "Modern": 566, "Mature": 313, "Youthful": 557, "Formal": 383, "Informal": 487, "Upper Class": 339, "Common": 531, "Urban": 392, "Natural": 478, "Wholesome": 548, "Devious": 322, "Strong": 687, "Delicate": 183, "Refined": 461, "Rough": 409, "Strange": 539, "Boring": 331, "Simple": 583, "Complex": 287, "Serious": 418, "Comedic": 452, "Nerdy": 478, "Unintellectual": 392}}, {"name": "Jordana", "gender": "F", "usage": ["Spanish", "Portuguese", "Macedonian", "Serbian", "English (Rare)"], "meaning": "\nFeminine form of Jordan.\n", "attribute": {"A Good Name": 43, "A Bad Name": 18, "Masculine": 2, "Feminine": 59, "Classic": 27, "Modern": 34, "Mature": 29, "Youthful": 32, "Formal": 40, "Informal": 21, "Upper Class": 43, "Common": 18, "Urban": 33, "Natural": 28, "Wholesome": 40, "Devious": 21, "Strong": 49, "Delicate": 12, "Refined": 38, "Rough": 23, "Strange": 46, "Boring": 15, "Simple": 32, "Complex": 29, "Serious": 43, "Comedic": 18, "Nerdy": 29, "Unintellectual": 32}}, {"name": "Jordon", "gender": "M", "usage": ["English"], "meaning": "\nVariant of Jordan.\n", "attribute": {"A Good Name": 24, "A Bad Name": 18, "Masculine": 32, "Feminine": 10, "Classic": 11, "Modern": 31, "Mature": 10, "Youthful": 32, "Formal": 13, "Informal": 29, "Upper Class": 8, "Common": 34, "Urban": 25, "Natural": 17, "Wholesome": 23, "Devious": 19, "Strong": 32, "Delicate": 10, "Refined": 18, "Rough": 24, "Strange": 23, "Boring": 19, "Simple": 31, "Complex": 11, "Serious": 14, "Comedic": 28, "Nerdy": 15, "Unintellectual": 27}}, {"name": "Jordyn", "gender": "F", "usage": ["English (Modern)"], "meaning": "\nFeminine variant of Jordan.\n", "attribute": {"A Good Name": 72, "A Bad Name": 46, "Masculine": 37, "Feminine": 81, "Classic": 22, "Modern": 96, "Mature": 34, "Youthful": 84, "Formal": 33, "Informal": 85, "Upper Class": 46, "Common": 72, "Urban": 65, "Natural": 53, "Wholesome": 63, "Devious": 55, "Strong": 76, "Delicate": 42, "Refined": 60, "Rough": 58, "Strange": 73, "Boring": 45, "Simple": 68, "Complex": 50, "Serious": 46, "Comedic": 72, "Nerdy": 50, "Unintellectual": 68}}, {"name": "Jorie", "gender": "F", "usage": ["English"], "meaning": "\nShort form of Marjorie.\n", "attribute": {"A Good Name": 22, "A Bad Name": 17, "Masculine": 10, "Feminine": 29, "Classic": 9, "Modern": 30, "Mature": 9, "Youthful": 30, "Formal": 8, "Informal": 31, "Upper Class": 15, "Common": 24, "Urban": 19, "Natural": 20, "Wholesome": 25, "Devious": 14, "Strong": 20, "Delicate": 20, "Refined": 23, "Rough": 16, "Strange": 28, "Boring": 11, "Simple": 27, "Complex": 12, "Serious": 12, "Comedic": 27, "Nerdy": 16, "Unintellectual": 23}}, {"name": "Jorja", "gender": "F", "usage": ["English (Modern)"], "meaning": "\nVariant of Georgia.\n", "attribute": {"A Good Name": 36, "A Bad Name": 33, "Masculine": 9, "Feminine": 60, "Classic": 12, "Modern": 57, "Mature": 17, "Youthful": 52, "Formal": 13, "Informal": 56, "Upper Class": 23, "Common": 46, "Urban": 32, "Natural": 37, "Wholesome": 30, "Devious": 39, "Strong": 44, "Delicate": 25, "Refined": 26, "Rough": 43, "Strange": 55, "Boring": 14, "Simple": 43, "Complex": 26, "Serious": 21, "Comedic": 48, "Nerdy": 25, "Unintellectual": 44}}, {"name": "Josceline", "gender": "F", "usage": ["English (Rare)"], "meaning": "\nVariant of Jocelyn.\n", "attribute": {"A Good Name": 8, "A Bad Name": 7, "Masculine": 0, "Feminine": 15, "Classic": 9, "Modern": 6, "Mature": 9, "Youthful": 6, "Formal": 14, "Informal": 2, "Upper Class": 11, "Common": 4, "Urban": 6, "Natural": 9, "Wholesome": 6, "Devious": 9, "Strong": 6, "Delicate": 9, "Refined": 12, "Rough": 3, "Strange": 12, "Boring": 3, "Simple": 6, "Complex": 9, "Serious": 10, "Comedic": 4, "Nerdy": 10, "Unintellectual": 5}}, {"name": "Joselyn", "gender": "F", "usage": ["English (Modern)"], "meaning": "\nVariant of Jocelyn.\n", "attribute": {"A Good Name": 20, "A Bad Name": 10, "Masculine": 4, "Feminine": 26, "Classic": 10, "Modern": 20, "Mature": 16, "Youthful": 14, "Formal": 19, "Informal": 11, "Upper Class": 16, "Common": 14, "Urban": 14, "Natural": 16, "Wholesome": 16, "Devious": 14, "Strong": 16, "Delicate": 14, "Refined": 18, "Rough": 12, "Strange": 21, "Boring": 9, "Simple": 12, "Complex": 18, "Serious": 21, "Comedic": 9, "Nerdy": 18, "Unintellectual": 12}}, {"name": "Joseph", "gender": "M", "usage": ["English", "French", "German", "Biblical"], "meaning": "\nFrom Ioseph, the Latin form of Greek \u1f38\u03c9\u03c3\u03ae\u03c6 (Ioseph), which was from the Hebrew name \u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05e1\u05b5\u05e3 (Yosef) meaning \"he will add\", from the root \u05d9\u05b8\u05e1\u05b7\u05e3 (yasaf). In the Old Testament Joseph is the eleventh son of Jacob and the first with his wife Rachel. Because he was the favourite of his father, his older brothers sent him to Egypt and told their father that he had died. In Egypt, Joseph became an advisor to the pharaoh, and was eventually reconciled with his brothers when they came to Egypt during a famine. This name also occurs in the New Testament, belonging to Saint Joseph the husband of Mary, and to Joseph of Arimathea.In the Middle Ages, Joseph was a common Jewish name, being less frequent among Christians. In the late Middle Ages Saint Joseph became more highly revered, and the name became popular in Spain and Italy. In England it became common after the Protestant Reformation. In the United States it has stayed within the top 25 names for boys since 1880, making it one of the most enduringly popular names of this era.This name was borne by rulers of the Holy Roman Empire and Portugal. Other notable bearers include the founder of Mormonism Joseph Smith (1805-1844), Polish-British author Joseph Conrad (1857-1924) and the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin (1878-1953).", "attribute": {"A Good Name": 1701, "A Bad Name": 537, "Masculine": 2059, "Feminine": 179, "Classic": 1231, "Modern": 1007, "Mature": 1186, "Youthful": 1052, "Formal": 1231, "Informal": 1007, "Upper Class": 1119, "Common": 1119, "Urban": 1052, "Natural": 1186, "Wholesome": 1231, "Devious": 1007, "Strong": 1276, "Delicate": 962, "Refined": 1231, "Rough": 1007, "Strange": 1119, "Boring": 1119, "Simple": 1141, "Complex": 1097, "Serious": 1186, "Comedic": 1052, "Nerdy": 1209, "Unintellectual": 1029}}, {"name": "Josepha", "gender": "F", "usage": ["German (Archaic)", "English (Rare)"], "meaning": "\nFeminine form of Joseph.\n", "attribute": {"A Good Name": 16, "A Bad Name": 16, "Masculine": 4, "Feminine": 28, "Classic": 25, "Modern": 7, "Mature": 25, "Youthful": 7, "Formal": 23, "Informal": 9, "Upper Class": 22, "Common": 10, "Urban": 11, "Natural": 21, "Wholesome": 27, "Devious": 5, "Strong": 22, "Delicate": 10, "Refined": 20, "Rough": 12, "Strange": 23, "Boring": 9, "Simple": 12, "Complex": 20, "Serious": 24, "Comedic": 8, "Nerdy": 21, "Unintellectual": 11}}, {"name": "Josephina", "gender": "F", "usage": ["English (Rare)"], "meaning": "\nLatinate variant of Jos\u00e9phine.\n", "attribute": {"A Good Name": 26, "A Bad Name": 6, "Masculine": 1, "Feminine": 31, "Classic": 30, "Modern": 2, "Mature": 25, "Youthful": 7, "Formal": 29, "Informal": 3, "Upper Class": 29, "Common": 3, "Urban": 7, "Natural": 25, "Wholesome": 29, "Devious": 3, "Strong": 20, "Delicate": 12, "Refined": 29, "Rough": 3, "Strange": 23, "Boring": 9, "Simple": 9, "Complex": 23, "Serious": 27, "Comedic": 5, "Nerdy": 20, "Unintellectual": 12}}, {"name": "Josephine", "gender": "F", "usage": ["English", "German", "Dutch"], "meaning": "\nEnglish, German and Dutch form of Jos\u00e9phine.\n", "attribute": {"A Good Name": 290, "A Bad Name": 72, "Masculine": 11, "Feminine": 351, "Classic": 319, "Modern": 43, "Mature": 261, "Youthful": 101, "Formal": 319, "Informal": 43, "Upper Class": 286, "Common": 76, "Urban": 123, "Natural": 239, "Wholesome": 300, "Devious": 62, "Strong": 214, "Delicate": 148, "Refined": 304, "Rough": 58, "Strange": 214, "Boring": 148, "Simple": 148, "Complex": 214, "Serious": 264, "Comedic": 98, "Nerdy": 253, "Unintellectual": 109}}, {"name": "Josey", "gender": "M", "usage": ["English"], "meaning": "\nDiminutive of Joseph.\n", "attribute": {"A Good Name": 12, "A Bad Name": 0, "Masculine": 11, "Feminine": 1, "Classic": 0, "Modern": 12, "Mature": 0, "Youthful": 12, "Formal": 5, "Informal": 7, "Upper Class": 7, "Common": 5, "Urban": 9, "Natural": 3, "Wholesome": 11, "Devious": 1, "Strong": 11, "Delicate": 1, "Refined": 12, "Rough": 0, "Strange": 6, "Boring": 6, "Simple": 6, "Complex": 6, "Serious": 6, "Comedic": 6, "Nerdy": 12, "Unintellectual": 0}}, {"name": "Josh", "gender": "M", "usage": ["English"], "meaning": "\nShort form of Joshua.\n", "attribute": {"A Good Name": 161, "A Bad Name": 80, "Masculine": 200, "Feminine": 41, "Classic": 99, "Modern": 142, "Mature": 87, "Youthful": 154, "Formal": 70, "Informal": 171, "Upper Class": 67, "Common": 174, "Urban": 104, "Natural": 137, "Wholesome": 130, "Devious": 111, "Strong": 171, "Delicate": 70, "Refined": 113, "Rough": 128, "Strange": 108, "Boring": 133, "Simple": 171, "Complex": 70, "Serious": 94, "Comedic": 147, "Nerdy": 108, "Unintellectual": 133}}, {"name": "Joshua", "gender": "M", "usage": ["English", "Biblical"], "meaning": "\nFrom the Hebrew name \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9\u05e9\u05bb\u05c1\u05e2\u05b7 (Yehoshu'a) meaning \"Yahweh is salvation\", from the roots \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9 (yeho) referring to the Hebrew God and \u05d9\u05b8\u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05e2 (yasha') meaning \"to save\".

The etymology is debated: it could derive from an earlier Greek name \u1f19\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7 (Hekaterine), itself from \u1f11\u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (hekateros) meaning \"each of the two\"; it could derive from the name of the goddess Hecate; it could be related to Greek \u03b1\u1f30\u03ba\u03af\u03b1 (aikia) meaning \"torture\"; or it could be from a Coptic name meaning \"my consecration of your name\". In the early Christian era it became associated with Greek \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03b1\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 (katharos) meaning \"pure\", and the Latin spelling was changed from Katerina to Katharina to reflect this.The name was borne by a semi-legendary 4th-century saint and martyr from Alexandria who was tortured on a spiked wheel. The saint was initially venerated in Syria, and returning crusaders introduced the name to Western Europe. It has been common in England since the 12th century in many different spellings, with Katherine and Catherine becoming standard in the later Middle Ages. To this day both spellings are regularly used in the English-speaking world. In the United States the spelling Katherine has been more popular since 1973.Famous bearers of the name include Catherine of Siena, a 14th-century mystic, and Catherine de' Medici, a 16th-century French queen. It was also borne by three of Henry VIII's wives, including Katherine of Aragon, and by two empresses of Russia, including Catherine the Great.\n", "attribute": {"A Good Name": 837, "A Bad Name": 222,

According to the gospels, Jesus was conceived in her by the Holy Spirit while she remained a virgin. This name was also borne by Mary Magdalene, a woman cured of demons by Jesus. She became one of his followers and later witnessed his crucifixion and resurrection.Due to the Virgin Mary this name has been very popular in the Christian world, though at certain times in some cultures it has been considered too holy for everyday use. In England it has been used since the 12th century, and it has been among the most common feminine names since the 16th century. In the United States in 1880 it was given more than twice as often as the next most popular name for girls (Anna).

Although it regained the top spot for a few more years in the 1950s it was already falling in usage, and has since dropped out of the top 100 names.This name has been borne by two queens of England, as well as a queen of Scotland, Mary Queen of Scots. Another notable bearer was Mary Shelley (1797-1851), the author of Frankenstein. A famous fictional character by this name is Mary Poppins from the children's books by P. L.

Many of the epistles in the New Testament were authored by him.Due to the renown of Saint Paul the name became common among early Christians. It was borne by a number of other early saints and six popes. In England it was relatively rare during the Middle Ages, but became more frequent beginning in the 17th century. In the United States it was in the top 20 names for boys from 1900 to 1968, while in the United Kingdom it was very popular from the 1950s to the 80s. It has also been heavily used in Germany and France and continues to be popular there, though it is currently on the decline in the English-speaking world.A notable bearer was the American Revolutionary War figure Paul Revere (1735-1818), who warned of the advance of the British army. Famous bearers in the art world include the French impressionists Paul Cezanne (1839-1906) and Paul Gauguin (1848-1903), and the Swiss expressionist Paul Klee (1879-1940).

It was the name of characters in the novels Tom Jones (1749) by Henry Fielding and The Vicar of Wakefield (1766) by Oliver Goldsmith.In the United States this name was only moderately common until the 1990s when it began rising in popularity, eventually becoming the most popular for girls from 2011 to 2013. A famous bearer is the Italian actress Sophia Loren (1934-).", "attribute": {"A Good Name": 702, "A Bad Name": 210, "Masculine": 36, "Feminine": 876, "Classic": 711, "Modern": 201, "Mature": 465, "Youthful": 447, "Formal": 684, "Informal": 228, "Upper Class": 611, "Common": 301, "Urban": 292, "Natural": 620, "Wholesome": 693, "Devious": 219, "Strong": 429, "Delicate": 483, "Refined": 730, "Rough": 182, "Strange": 529, "Boring": 383, "Simple": 565, "Complex": 347, "Serious": 611, "Comedic": 301, "Nerdy": 584, "Unintellectual": 328}}, {"name": "Sophie", "gender": "F", "usage": ["French", "English", "German", "Dutch"], "meaning": "\nFrench form of Sophia.\n", "attribute": {"A Good Name": 509, "A Bad Name": 135, "Masculine": 19, "Feminine": 625, "Classic": 431, "Modern": 213, "Mature": 219, "Youthful": 425, "Formal": 361, "Informal": 283, "Upper Class": 393, "Common": 251, "Urban": 213, "Natural": 431, "Wholesome": 483, "Devious": 161, "Strong": 245, "Delicate": 399, "Refined": 509, "Rough": 135, "Strange": 361, "Boring": 283, "Simple": 464, "Complex": 180, "Serious": 380, "Comedic": 264, "Nerdy": 412, "Unintellectual": 232}}, {"name": "Sophy", "gender": "F", "usage": ["English (Rare)"], "meaning": "\nVariant of Sophie or a diminutive of Sophia.\n", "attribute": {"A Good Name": 24, "A Bad Name": 12, "Masculine": 0, "Feminine": 36, "Classic": 23, "Modern": 13, "Mature": 6, "Youthful": 30, "Formal": 9, "Informal": 27, "Upper Class": 21, "Common": 15, "Urban": 18, "Natural": 18, "Wholesome": 27, "Devious": 9, "Strong": 9, "Delicate": 27, "Refined": 27, "Rough": 9, "Strange": 22, "Boring": 14, "Simple": 23, "Complex": 13, "Serious": 20, "Comedic": 16, "Nerdy": 19, "Unintellectual": 17}}, {"name": "Soren", "gender": "M", "usage": ["English (Modern)"], "meaning": "\nEnglish form of S\u00f8ren.\n", "attribute": {"A Good Name": 6, "A Bad Name": 2, "Masculine": 6, "Feminine": 2, "Classic": 3, "Modern": 5, "Mature": 2, "Youthful": 6, "Formal": 4, "Informal": 4, "Upper Class": 4, "Common": 4, "Urban": 3, "Natural": 5, "Wholesome": 4, "Devious": 4, "Strong": 5, "Delicate": 3, "Refined": 6, "Rough": 2, "Strange": 6, "Boring": 2, "Simple": 5, "Complex": 3, "Serious": 6, "Comedic": 2, "Nerdy": 4, "Unintellectual": 4}}, {"name": "Sorrel", "gender": "F", "usage": ["English (Rare)"], "meaning": "\nFrom the name of the sour tasting plant, which may ultimately derive from Germanic sur \"sour\".", "attribute": {"A Good Name": 50, "A Bad Name": 16, "Masculine": 25, "Feminine": 41, "Classic": 48, "Modern": 18, "Mature": 32, "Youthful": 34, "Formal": 40, "Informal": 26, "Upper Class": 42, "Common": 24, "Urban": 10, "Natural": 56, "Wholesome": 42, "Devious": 24, "Strong": 41, "Delicate": 25, "Refined": 40, "Rough": 26, "Strange": 58, "Boring": 8, "Simple": 30, "Complex": 36, "Serious": 44, "Comedic": 22, "Nerdy": 45, "Unintellectual": 21}}, {"name": "Sparrow", "gender": "U", "usage": ["English (Rare)"], "meaning": "\nFrom the name of the bird, ultimately from Old English spearwa.", "attribute": {"A Good Name": 77, "A Bad Name": 22, "Masculine": 46, "Feminine": 53, "Classic": 35, "Modern": 64, "Mature": 20, "Youthful": 79, "Formal": 23, "Informal": 76, "Upper Class": 41, "Common": 58, "Urban": 20, "Natural": 79, "Wholesome": 56, "Devious": 43, "Strong": 50, "Delicate": 50, "Refined": 50, "Rough": 49, "Strange": 84, "Boring": 15, "Simple": 64, "Complex": 35, "Serious": 44, "Comedic": 55, "Nerdy": 53, "Unintellectual": 46}}, {"name": "Spencer", "gender": "M", "usage": ["English"], "meaning": "\nFrom an English surname that meant \"dispenser of provisions\", derived from Middle English spense \"larder, pantry\".
